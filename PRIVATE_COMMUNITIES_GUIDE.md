# Private Communities Feature Guide

## Overview

Private communities are exclusive spaces where only invited or approved members can see and participate in community content. This feature enables creators to build more intimate, focused communities with controlled access.

## How Private Communities Work

### 1. **Visibility & Discovery**

#### Public Communities
- Visible to everyone in community listings
- Anyone can see community details, member count, and description
- Appear in search results and featured sections
- Can be joined immediately by anyone

#### Private Communities  
- **Not visible** in public community listings by default
- Only members can see community details and content
- Do not appear in general search results
- Require invitation or approval to join

### 2. **Database Implementation**

The privacy system is implemented using PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

```sql
-- Public communities are viewable by everyone
CREATE POLICY "Public communities are viewable by everyone" ON "communities"
  FOR SELECT USING (NOT is_private);
  
-- Private communities are only viewable by members
CREATE POLICY "Private communities are viewable by members" ON "communities"
  FOR SELECT USING (
    is_private AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM "community_members" 
      WHERE "community_id" = "communities"."id" AND "user_id" = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### 3. **Access Control Levels**

#### Creator/Owner
- Full admin access to community settings
- Can invite members via email or username
- Can approve/reject join requests
- Can change community from private to public (and vice versa)

#### Members

- Can participate in discussions and events

#### Non-Members
- Cannot see the community exists
- Cannot access any community content
- Cannot see member lists or activity

### 4. **Joining Private Communities**

#### Invitation System
1. **Direct Invitation**: Community creators can invite users via:
   - Email address
