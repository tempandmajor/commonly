   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Platform Environment Variables**
   - Copy variables from `.env.production`
   - Ensure all required variables are set
   - Double-check no secret keys are included

3. **Deploy**
   - Platform will automatically build and deploy
   - Monitor build logs for any errors
   - Check deployed site functionality

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Site loads correctly
   - [ ] Authentication works
   - [ ] Database connections work
   - [ ] Payment processing works (if applicable)
   - [ ] No console errors

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Ensure variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Site loads but features don't work**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify Supabase URL and keys are correct
- Check if Row Level Security is blocking requests

**Payment features not working**
- Verify Stripe publishable key is set
- Check if using correct keys (test vs production)
- Ensure Stripe webhooks are configured

**"Unauthorized" or "Forbidden" errors**
- Check Supabase RLS policies
- Verify user authentication is working
- Check API endpoint permissions

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Review deployment platform build logs
3. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
4. Ensure your Supabase project is properly configured
