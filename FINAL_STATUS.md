## Risk Assessment

### High Risk üî¥
1. **4,335 remaining type errors** - May hide runtime bugs
   **Mitigation**: Focus on high-impact files first, comprehensive testing

2. **Rate limiting not applied** - Vulnerable to DoS attacks
   **Mitigation**: Infrastructure ready, quick deployment possible

3. **Low overall test coverage** - Bugs may reach production
   **Mitigation**: High coverage for critical paths (90%+)

### Medium Risk üü°
1. **4 npm vulnerabilities** - May have security issues
   **Mitigation**: Run audit fix, test thoroughly

2. **No E2E tests** - Integration issues may not be caught
   **Mitigation**: Manual testing of critical flows

3. **Performance not optimized** - May have slow load times
   **Mitigation**: Current performance acceptable, optimization planned

### Low Risk üü¢
1. **Documentation incomplete** - Team may need more guidance
   **Mitigation**: 15,000+ words of documentation already created

2. **No load testing** - Unknown behavior under high load
   **Mitigation**: Start with lower traffic, scale gradually
