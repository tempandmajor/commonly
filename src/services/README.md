# Service Architecture Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the standard service architecture pattern for the Commonly application. All services should follow this structure for consistency and maintainability.

## Service Structure
Each service should be organized with the following structure:

```
services/
└── serviceName/
    ├── index.ts          # Main entry point that re-exports all functionality
    ├── types.ts          # Type definitions for the service
    ├── api.ts            # Core API functions for the service
    ├── utils.ts          # Utility functions used by the service
    ├── validation.ts     # Input validation for the service
    ├── cache.ts          # Caching mechanisms (if applicable)
    ├── analytics.ts      # Analytics tracking (if applicable)
    └── compatibility.ts  # Backward compatibility layer
```

## Best Practices

1. **Type Safety**: All services must be fully typed with proper interfaces and type definitions.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling with proper error messages.

3. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Always maintain backward compatibility when consolidating services.

5. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all service functionality.

6. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs with JSDoc comments.

## Consolidation Process

When consolidating services:

1. Create the new service structure following the standard pattern
2. Migrate functionality from existing services
3. Create compatibility layers that re-export from the new structure
4. Add deprecation notices to old service files
5. Update references gradually throughout the codebase

## Examples
See the consolidated services for examples of proper implementation:
- `services/order/` - Order management service
- `services/message/` - Messaging service
- `services/promotion/` - Promotion service
- `services/validation/` - Validation service
- `services/ticket/` - Ticket service
