The application is secure for production deployment with the implemented infrastructure.

---

## NPM Dependency Vulnerabilities

### Current Status
```bash
7 moderate severity vulnerabilities
```

### Analysis

All vulnerabilities are in **development dependencies only**:
- `esbuild` (<=0.24.2) - Development build tool
- `vite` - Development server
- `vitest` - Testing framework
- `@vitest/*` - Testing utilities

### Vulnerability Details

**CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
**Component**: esbuild <=0.24.2
**Severity**: Moderate
**Description**: esbuild enables any website to send requests to development server

**Impact Analysis**:
- ✅ Only affects development environment
- ✅ Does NOT affect production builds
- ✅ Does NOT affect deployed application
- ✅ Mitigated by not exposing dev server publicly

### Recommendation

**Priority**: Medium
**Timeline**: Next maintenance window

**Options**:
1. **Run `npm audit fix --force`** (Breaking changes)
   - Updates to vitest@3.2.4
   - May require test updates
   - Recommended for next sprint

2. **Accept Risk** (Current approach)
   - Vulnerabilities only affect development
   - Development servers not exposed publicly
   - No impact on production security
   - ✅ **Currently Acceptable**

3. **Update Manually** (Safest)
   - Update each dependency individually
   - Test thoroughly after each update
   - Time-consuming but no surprises
