- **Private Network Support**: Allow access from local development environments
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Can be configured for specific regions

### ‚è∞ Time-Based Access Control
- **Business Hours Restrictions**: Limit access to specific hours and days
- **After-Hours Override**: Allow access outside business hours with additional authentication
- **Configurable Schedule**: Customizable time windows and allowed days

### üõ°Ô∏è Session Management
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic logout after configured duration
- **Inactivity Timeout**: Session timeout during periods of inactivity
- **Session Validation**: Continuous session integrity checks

### üìä Activity Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All admin activities are logged with timestamps
- **Security Event Tracking**: Failed login attempts, unauthorized access, security violations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of administrative actions for compliance

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file for production:

```bash
# Admin Security Configuration
VITE_ADMIN_IP_RESTRICTIONS=true
VITE_ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.100,10.0.0.50
VITE_ADMIN_TIME_RESTRICTIONS=true
VITE_ADMIN_ALLOW_AFTER_HOURS=false
VITE_ADMIN_SECURITY_LOGGING=true
```

### Configuration Options

The security system is configured in `src/config/adminSecurity.ts`:

#### IP Restrictions
```typescript
ipRestrictions: {
  enabled: true,                    // Enable IP-based access control
  allowedIPs: ['192.168.1.100'],   // Specific allowed IP addresses
  allowPrivateNetworks: false,     // Allow local network access
}
```

#### Time Restrictions
```typescript
timeRestrictions: {
  enabled: true,
  businessHours: {
    enabled: true,
    startHour: 6,                   // 6 AM
    endHour: 23,                    // 11 PM
    allowedDays: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],   // Monday to Friday
  },
  allowAfterHours: false,           // Require additional auth after hours
}
```

#### Session Management
```typescript
session: {
  maxDuration: 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000,      // 8 hours
  inactivityTimeout: 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 2 hours
  requireReauth: true,
}
```

## Security Access Flow

### 1. Initial Authentication
- User navigates to `/admin/login`
- Provides email and password credentials
- System verifies admin role

### 2. Security Verification
- **IP Check**: Validates request origin
- **Time Check**: Confirms access during allowed hours
- **Session Check**: Verifies session validity
- **Browser Security**: Checks for secure connection and features

### 3. Additional Authentication (if required)
- **Time-Based Codes**: Generated every 10 minutes (configurable)
- **Security Code Format**: `ADMIN{hour}{rounded_minute}`
- **Example**: At 14:25, code would be `ADMIN1420`

### 4. Continuous Monitoring
- All activities logged with timestamps
- Session timeout monitoring
- Failed attempt tracking
- Automatic lockout after max attempts

## Time-Based Security Codes

### How They Work
- Generated based on current time
- Change every configurable interval (default: 10 minutes)
- Format: `ADMIN` + current hour + rounded minute interval

### Examples
- **2:15 PM**: `ADMIN1410` (rounded to nearest 10 minutes)
- **2:25 PM**: `ADMIN1420`
- **2:35 PM**: `ADMIN1430`

### When Required
- Access outside business hours
- Access from non-whitelisted IPs
- Session expired scenarios
- Security policy violations

## Activity Logging

### Logged Events
- **ACCESS_ATTEMPT**: User attempts to access admin portal
- **ACCESS_GRANTED**: Successful admin portal access
- **ACCESS_DENIED**: Failed access attempt with reason
- **UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS**: Non-admin user attempts access
- **SECURITY_CODE_VALID**: Successful additional authentication
- **SECURITY_CODE_INVALID**: Failed additional authentication
- **MAX_ATTEMPTS_EXCEEDED**: Too many failed attempts
- **SESSION_EXPIRED**: Session timeout occurred

### Log Structure
```typescript
{
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  userId: "user_123",
  action: "ACCESS_GRANTED",
  details: "Successfully accessed /admin/users",
  ip: "192.168.1.100",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0...",
  success: true
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Minimum 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols
2. **Enable 2FA**: Use additional authentication when available
3. **Limit Session Duration**: Don't stay logged in unnecessarily
4. **Monitor Activity Logs**: Regularly review access logs for suspicious activity
5. **Use Secure Networks**: Avoid public WiFi for admin access

### For System Administrators
1. **Configure IP Restrictions**: Limit access to known, secure locations
2. **Set Business Hours**: Restrict access to appropriate time windows
3. **Monitor Failed Attempts**: Set up alerts for repeated failed logins
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Review and update security configurations
5. **Keep Logs Secure**: Ensure activity logs are properly protected

### For Production Deployment
1. **Enable All Security Features**: Turn on IP restrictions, time limits, logging
2. **Use HTTPS Only**: Ensure secure connections for all admin access
3. **Regular Backups**: Backup security configurations and logs
4. **Update Dependencies**: Keep security libraries up to date
5. **Monitor System Health**: Set up alerts for security system failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Access Restricted" Message
- **Cause**: Failed security checks
- **Solution**: Check IP whitelist, time restrictions, session validity

#### "Session Expired" Error
- **Cause**: Session timeout or inactivity
- **Solution**: Re-login and adjust session duration if needed

#### "Invalid Security Code" Error
- **Cause**: Incorrect time-based code entry
- **Solution**: Use current time to generate correct code format

#### "Maximum Attempts Exceeded"
- **Cause**: Too many failed authentication attempts
- **Solution**: Wait for lockout period to expire or contact administrator

### Emergency Access
If locked out of admin portal:
1. Check server logs for specific error details
2. Verify environment variable configuration
3. Temporarily disable restrictions in development
4. Contact system administrator for production issues

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed login attempts per hour
- Access attempts from new IP addresses
- After-hours access frequency
- Session duration patterns
- Security code failure rates

### Alerts to Set Up
- Multiple failed attempts from same IP
- Access attempts outside business hours
- New IP addresses accessing admin portal
- Unusual activity patterns
- Security system errors

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Activity logs contain user identification data
- Ensure logs are encrypted and access-controlled
- Implement log retention policies
- Regular log archival and deletion

### Audit Requirements
- Maintain complete audit trail of admin activities
- Ensure logs are tamper-evident
- Regular security assessments
- Documentation of security procedures

## Updates and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review and update IP whitelist
- Adjust time restrictions as needed
- Monitor security log storage
- Update security code intervals
- Test emergency access procedures

### Security Updates
- Keep authentication libraries updated
- Review and update security policies
- Test security features after updates
- Document configuration changes
- Train administrators on new features
