### Deployment Checklist

#### ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Configure IP whitelist with trusted addresses only
- [ ] Set custom admin portal path (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Enable all security features in environment variables
- [ ] Test admin access from allowed IP addresses
- [ ] Verify time restrictions work as expected

#### ‚úÖ Post-Deployment
- [ ] Confirm admin portal is not accessible from unauthorized IPs
- [ ] Verify robots.txt is blocking admin routes
- [ ] Test that admin portal doesn't appear in search results
- [ ] Monitor admin activity logs for any suspicious activity
- [ ] Set up alerts for failed login attempts

### Security Best Practices

#### üè¢ Network Security
1. **Use VPN**: Connect through company VPN for admin access
2. **Static IPs**: Use static IP addresses for the whitelist
3. **Regular Updates**: Update IP whitelist when team members change locations
4. **Monitor Access**: Regularly review admin access logs

#### üë§ User Security
1. **Strong Passwords**: Require complex passwords for admin accounts
2. **2FA Ready**: System supports additional authentication methods
3. **Limited Sessions**: Keep admin sessions short and logout when done
4. **Secure Devices**: Only access admin portal from secure, trusted devices

#### üîç Monitoring
1. **Activity Logs**: Review admin activity logs weekly
2. **Failed Attempts**: Set up alerts for multiple failed login attempts
3. **Unusual Access**: Monitor for access from new IP addresses
4. **Time Anomalies**: Watch for unusual access times

### Emergency Access

If you're locked out of the admin portal:

1. **Check IP Address**: Ensure you're accessing from a whitelisted IP
2. **Time Restrictions**: Verify you're within business hours
3. **Environment Variables**: Check that security settings are correct
4. **Server Logs**: Review server logs for specific error messages

### Customization Options

#### Custom Admin Path
```bash
# Instead of /admin, use a custom path
VITE_ADMIN_CUSTOM_PATH=/management-dashboard-secure-2024
```

#### Relaxed Development Settings
```bash
# For staging/development environments
VITE_ADMIN_IP_RESTRICTIONS=false
VITE_ADMIN_TIME_RESTRICTIONS=false
VITE_ADMIN_ADDITIONAL_AUTH=false
```

#### Enhanced Security
```bash
# For maximum security
VITE_ADMIN_IP_RESTRICTIONS=true
VITE_ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=single.trusted.ip.only
VITE_ADMIN_TIME_RESTRICTIONS=true
VITE_ADMIN_ALLOW_AFTER_HOURS=false
VITE_ADMIN_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS=false
```

### Security Incident Response

If unauthorized access is detected:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Change all admin passwords
   - Update IP whitelist to remove compromised addresses
   - Review and rotate API keys
   - Check admin activity logs for unauthorized actions

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review server access logs
   - Check for any data modifications
   - Verify system integrity
   - Document the incident

3. **Prevention**:
   - Strengthen IP restrictions
   - Reduce session timeouts
   - Enable additional security measures
   - Update security procedures

### Support and Maintenance

#### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review admin activity logs
- **Monthly**: Update IP whitelist as needed
- **Quarterly**: Security configuration review
- **Annually**: Complete security audit

#### Updates
- Keep security configurations up to date
- Monitor for new security features
- Test security measures after updates
- Document any configuration changes
